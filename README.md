# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Angular. It offers two gameplay options: Play against the CPU or witha nother human player on the same device. The CPU has been programmed with a strategy to win and prevent the opponent from winning.

The project is based on Angular and after building the app, it is served using a simple Node.js server on file server.js
