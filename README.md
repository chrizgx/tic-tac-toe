# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Angular. It offers two gameplay options: Play against the CPU or witha nother human player on the same device. The CPU has been programmed with a strategy to win and prevent the opponent from winning.

The project is based on Angular and after building the app, it is served using a simple Node.js server on file server.js

### Features

### Conclusion

This Tic-Tac-Toe project showcases my ability to build interactive web applications using Angular and Node.js. The game provides a fun and engaging user experience, while the code behind it demonstrates a solid understanding of modern web development practices. Whether you're a recruiter looking for a skilled developer, or a fellow programmer seeking inspiration for your own projects, I hope you find this project both interesting and informative. I'm always open to feedback and opportunities to collaborate, so please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy gaming!
